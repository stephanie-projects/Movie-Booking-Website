# Movie-Booking-Website
This is a movie booking website concept made with PHP, HTML, and JavaScript. Allows a user to create an account and navigate the site to book a ticket to a showing.
You can unzip the the file and as long as all the components are in the same folder on your computer you can run the main file index.php on any IDE that runs php files. I also have the repl.it website where you can run the code as well.
